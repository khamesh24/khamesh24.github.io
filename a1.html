    <h2>Circuit Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I built a parallel circuit with three LEDs (Red, Blue, Yellow). Each LED has its own resistor,
      and its anode connects to a different Arduino digital pin so each LED can blink independently.
      The cathodes are all connected to ground (GND).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red LED → resistor → Arduino pin 13</li>
      <li>Blue LED → resistor → Arduino pin 12</li>
      <li>Yellow LED → resistor → Arduino pin 8</li>
      <li>All LED cathodes → GND</li>
    </ul>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Each LED has its own resistor to limit current. The anodes connect to digital pins 13, 12, 8, and
      the cathodes connect to GND.
    </p>

    <h2>Resistor Calculations (Ohm’s Law)</h2>
    <p>
      Supply voltage (V<sub>S</sub>) = 5V<br />
      Recommended current (I) = 16 mA = 0.016 A<br />
      R = V / I, where V is the voltage across the resistor.
    </p>

    <h3>Red and Yellow LEDs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Forward voltage (V<sub>F</sub>) = 1.8V</li>
      <li>Voltage across resistor = 5 - 1.8 = 3.2V</li>
      <li>R = 3.2 / 0.016 = 200 Ω</li>
      <li>Used 220 Ω (common value, slightly safer and limits current a bit more)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Blue LED</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Forward voltage (V<sub>F</sub>) = 3.3V</li>
      <li>Voltage across resistor = 5 - 3.3 = 1.7V</li>
      <li>R = 1.7 / 0.016 = 106.25 Ω</li>
      <li>Used 120 Ω (common value)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Arduino Code (Each line explained above it)</h2>
    <pre><code>
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
int redPin = 13;
int bluePin = 12;
int yellowPin = 8;

void setup() {
  // set the red LED pin as an output
  pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);
  // set the blue LED pin as an output
  pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT);
  // set the yellow LED pin as an output
  pinMode(yellowPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // turn on the yellow LED
  digitalWrite(yellowPin, HIGH);
  // wait for 100 milliseconds
  delay(100);
  // turn off the yellow LED
  digitalWrite(yellowPin, LOW);
  // wait for 100 milliseconds
  delay(100);

  // turn on the yellow LED again
  digitalWrite(yellowPin, HIGH);
  // wait for 100 milliseconds
  delay(100);
  // turn off the yellow LED
  digitalWrite(yellowPin, LOW);
  // wait for 300 milliseconds before the next LED
  delay(300);

  // turn on the red LED
  digitalWrite(redPin, HIGH);
  // wait for 100 milliseconds
  delay(100);
  // turn off the red LED
  digitalWrite(redPin, LOW);
  // wait for 100 milliseconds
  delay(100);

    <h2>Timing Graph: LED Voltage vs. Time</h2>

      <figcaption>Figure 2. Voltage across each LED over time.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The X-axis represents time and the Y-axis represents voltage across each LED. Each trace shows
      when the LED is ON (≈V<sub>F</sub>) or OFF (≈0V). The square waves are slightly phase-shifted
      to show independent blinking.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

    <h3>2) How many LEDs could you blink independently, and how much current?</h3>
    <p>
      I was able to get 13 LEDs to blink independently. Each draws around 16 mA, so the total ideal
      current would be 13 × 16 mA = 208 mA. Since the Arduino Uno can safely source about 200 mA
      total, the current would distribute roughly evenly—around 15.4 mA per LED.
    </p>

    <h3>3) How many if only one LED is on at once?</h3>
    <p>
      If only one LED is on at a time, the number of independently controlled LEDs is limited by
      available pins—about 20 (using D2–D13 and A0–A5). The current draw would then just be that of
      a single LED (about 10–16 mA).
    </p>

    <h3>4) Blink speed threshold (persistence of vision)</h3>
    <p>
      Around a 10 ms delay per state (100 Hz) the blinking appears steady to the human eye.
      Increasing the delay to around 15 ms makes the blinking visible again.
    </p>

    <h3>5) Use of AI Tools</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. I used AI tools to help check my resistor calculations with Ohm’s Law, verify my parallel
      circuit wiring, format this documentation, and create the Arduino code comments. I confirmed
      all final values and code behavior independently.
